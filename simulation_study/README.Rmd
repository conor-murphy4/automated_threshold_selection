# Overview of simulation_study sections

R code used in Section 6 of main text and Section S:4 of the supplementary materials.

## Section Overview

`cases_1-4` contains R code to reproduce the simulation and estimated thresholds for Cases 1-4 in the main paper.

`coverage_probabilities` contains R code to reproduce the coverage probabilities for Case 4 data provided in Section 6 of the main text.

`JointMLEFunctions.r` contains R code to implement the Wadsworth 2016 method as used in Section 6 of the main text.

Code to reproduce simulation results and coverage probabilities for Gaussian samples will be added shortly. Code to reproduce results from the supplementary material will also be added soon.
